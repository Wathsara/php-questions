You have a machine that counts the number of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a givensample.
Input Format
The input consists of a single line with three space separated integers:c,h, and o 
where
c is the count of carbon atomsh​is the count of hydrogen atomso is the count of oxygen atoms Constraints
0≤c,h,o< 1010
Output Format
If the number of atoms is consistent  with a mixture containing only water, carbon dioxide, and glucosemolecules , 
the output should consist of a single line containing three space separated integers: thenumber of water molecules,
the number of carbon dioxide molecules, and the number of glucosemolecules.If the number of atoms is not consistent
with a mixture containing only water, carbon dioxide, andglucose molecules , the output should consist of a line 
containing the word Error
